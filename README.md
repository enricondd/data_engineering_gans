# data_engineering_gans

This project was about exploring the field of Data Engineering through a real-life business case.

A car-sharing company is planning to expand to the biggest cities in Europe. 
The idea is to have, in each city, cars ready at the most important hotspots (train stations, airports) and around the city center, so that customers wonâ€™t have to wait or walk too long to start their ride.
In order to be successful, we will have to predict when and where the cars will be more needed. 
Several flights landing at the airport around 2 pm? Rainy day? Customers might want to get a car!
To predict the behavior of our potential customers, we must start with Data! For example, we might want to know the weather forecast for the next day, or get the flight schedules for the nearby airport. 
How can we do that?
